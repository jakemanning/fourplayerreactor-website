Hey there! I'm Jake. I graduated from University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I taught myself iOS development the summer of my Freshman year.

Four Player Reactor is the first large project I worked on.

Currently I work full-time as a Software Engineer in Seattle, Washington. I work on Four Player Reactor as a hobby project when I have the time.
