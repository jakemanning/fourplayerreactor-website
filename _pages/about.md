## Jake Manning
### Software Developer

<p style="text-align: center;">
Hi there! I'm Jake. I recently graduated from University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I taught myself iOS development in the summer of Freshman year. Four Player Reactor is the first large project I worked on.

Currently Four Player reactor is a side project, while I work full-time as a Software Engineer in Seattle, Washington.
